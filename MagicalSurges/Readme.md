# Magical Surges

This is an script for processing magical surges for characters automatically.
It allows for customization of your surge list and the ability to select which characters it will run on automatically.

This script has only been tested on the 5eOGL character sheet and modifications for any other sheet may be necessary.

This project started as a modification of https://github.com/RobinKuiper/Roll20APIScripts/blob/master/WildMagic.js


# Usage
To use this script make sure to modify the two constants to fit your needs.  

First "const CHARACTERS" on line 9 must be a comma separated list of characters who you wish to use wild magic.

Second you can modify "const Surges" to match the wild magic surge table of your choice. The PHB table is not provided due to copyright, however you can enter it in yourself.
